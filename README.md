## What can it do :question:

Openthesia includes two main modes, **Midi playback** and **Play mode**.

In the Midi playback mode you can select a midi file to play and choose between just visualizing and listening the note blocks or play along with it.
When playing along the playback will wait for the right note input before going to the next note.
In the Play mode you can visualize midi inputs as rising note blocks and also record them to later export the recording as a midi file.

## Features :star:

- **Fully customizable**: change background and note blocks color, turn on notes glowing effect
- **Midi playback**: play and visualize midi files at different speeds, tempo and notes direction
- **Learning mode**: wait for the right key input before going to the next note
- **Play mode**: visualize midi input realtime and record it to export it as a midi file
- **Hands separation**: differentiate between left and right hand with colors
- **SoundFonts support**: built-in and external sounds support through .sf2 files
- **Video recording**\*: capture video of your MIDI playbacks or performances and export them directly.
- **Plugins support**\*: use your favorite VST2 instruments and audio effects directly inside Openthesia!

\*Available with [Openthesia Supporter Edition](https://openthesia.pages.dev/supporter).

## What operating systems does it support? :desktop_computer:

Openthesia is officially supported on **Windows**.

However, it appears to be working almost flawlessly on **Linux** using [**Wine**](https://www.winehq.org/)!
If you're a Linux user and willing to experiment, you may still enjoy the full experience, just keep in mind that it's not officially supported or tested.
